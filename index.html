            My choice of vcs is no doubt <a href="https://git-scm.com/"><b>Git</b></a> and my infrastructure usually sits on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/"><b>AWS</b></a> ☁️ More likely than not I set it up with <a href="https://www.terraform.io/"><b>Terraform</b></a>.
            <br />
            Usually I prototype my <a href="https://reactjs.org/"><b>React</b></a> ⚛️ components with <a href="https://storybook.js.org/"><b>Storybook</b></a> and <a href="https://www.chromatic.com/"><b>Chromatic</b></a>. To manage my state, my first choice is <b>context</b> but if I can't have that, it's <b><a href="https://redux.js.org/">Redux</a></b> all the way. I bundle with <a href="https://webpack.js.org/"><b>Webpack</b></a> 📦 most of the time, but I'm happy to roll otherwise, such as up 😉

            The backend, it's either <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/"><b>Node</b></a> or <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/"><b>Django</b></a>, usually talking to a <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/"><b>Mongo</b></a> cluster, ideally in <a href="https://graphql.org/"><b>GraphQL</b></a>. I'm big on <b>testing</b> so <a href="https://jestjs.io/"><b>Jest</b></a> and <a href="https://www.cypress.io/"><b>Cypress</b></a> comes in really handy! For Cypress at least, testing is a boring use case. <b>Ask me more!</b> 😁

            Sadly, I have experience with <b>Wordpress</b> 🙁

                    News UK is a British newspaper publisher and one of the largest players in the industry.
                    In this role, my work was for <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/"><b>The Sun</b></a>, one of the largest
                    publications in the UK. I was part of <b>The Sun title team</b>, the group responsible for the development

            <ul>
                <li>
                    I improved The Sun performance across several <a href="https://web.dev/vitals/"><b>web vitals</b></a>, both core and non-core. I reduced both <a href="https://web.dev/fcp/"><b>First Contentful Paint</b></a> and <a href="https://web.dev/tti/"><b>Time to Interactive</b></a> by a few seconds, as well as improving the <a href="https://web.dev/cls/"><b>Cumulative Layout Shift</b></a> 📈
                </li>
                <li>
                    I overhauled the <b>CSS architecture</b> resulting in a two thirds decrease of the payload 💨 <a href="https://mayk.substack.com/p/css-how-it-works-and-how-to-make">Read more about it here</a>
                </li>

                <li>

                </li>
                <li>
                    I helped perform a major infrastructure change, moving The Sun from <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/"><b>AWS EB</b></a> to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/eks/"><b>EKS</b></a>. We did this in stages and employed a <b>blue/green</b> strategy for traffic routing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I collaborated closely with the <b>analytics</b> team on several occasions, for tasks ranging from <a href="https://tealium.com/"><b>Tealium</b></a> integration to setting up an entire <b>recommendation system</b>.
                </li>
                    I conducted several <b>A/B</b> and <a href="https://www.optimizely.com/optimization-glossary/multivariate-testing/#:~:text=Multivariate%20testing%20is%20a%20technique,of%20combinations%20of%20changeable%20elements."><b>multivariate tests</b></a> using <a href="https://www.optimizely.com/"><b>Optimizely</b></a> 👨‍🔬 resulting in improvements to metrics such as <b>recirculation</b>, <b>conversion</b> and <b>time on site</b>.

                    Using <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">node</a>, I build an evidence archiving system 🗃️ This system
                    used <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/04/headless-chrome">headless Chrome</a>
                    to visit and archive websites. Based on demand, node worker processes are created on a

                    EC2 autoscaling group</a>. They consume an api that provides them with urls to archive. The node
                    process connect to the headless chrome instance via
                    <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer">puppeteer</a> and drive the browser to the url
                    from the api. There, they screenshot and pdf the website or hidden service. The generated content

                </li>
                <li>
                    I designed and implemented a deep learning, <b>convolutional neural network</b> 🕸️ using the
                    <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">Tensorflow</a> framework together with
                    <a href="http://www.numpy.org/">numpy</a>, in python 3. This was based on Yann LeCun's
                    <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/lenet/">LeNet-5</a> network, adapted for text data as opposed to

                <li>
                    Developed and maintained the client application, wrote in <b>React</b>. This application allows

                </li>
                <li>
                    Additionally, I architected and deployed a client application capable of reaching both

                </li>
                <li>
                    I wrote an <b>orchestration system</b> for deploying and monitoring tor nodes. I used the python
                    <a href="https://github.com/boto/boto3">boto3</a> library to automatically provide and clean up
                    resources used by tor nodes, based on data obtained from status providers, both internal and

                </li>
                <li>
                    Set up a <b>private tor network</b> using

                    <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/chutney.git">here</a> ) and deployed
                    several patched Tor nodes, in order to assess different data collection strategies.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Used the python <a href="https://stem.torproject.org/">stem</a> library to build a client capable of
                    quickly assessing the status of hidden services on the tor network. This was done as part of an
                    effort to better understand and map the <b>hidden service lifecycle</b> 🔍
                </li>
                <li>
                    I improved the matching engine by moving from a regex search approach, done with the re2 library to
                    a search based on the
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aho%E2%80%93Corasick_algorithm">Aho–Corasick algorithm</a>.
                    This was done using <a href="https://github.com/mayk93/pyahocorasick">pyahocorasick</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Worked on developing a user facing, <b>mobile first</b> application,
                    built with <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a> and its material design implementation,
                    <a href="https://vuetifyjs.com/en/">Vuetify</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Used <a href="https://docs.seleniumhq.org/">Selenium</a> both for end to end testing and for content
                    collection. I build using Selenium a web crawler that rendered a Firefox browser in a
                    <a href="https://www.x.org/wiki/">x server</a> and used the browser to access otherwise unavailable
                    content, such as those hidden behind a captcha.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I built an <b>asynchronous</b> client application using the
                    <a href="https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/">Twisted</a> library for python2.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Dramatically improved the <b>performance</b> of the document matching engine by switching from
                    python's native <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html">re</a> library to
                    <a href="https://github.com/google/re2">Google’s re2 regex engine</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Developed several <b>Django</b>
                    and web.py apps used internally, along with some REST apis.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Used <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> and

                I learned to built networks the hard way. SSH-ing into machines, doing manual configuration, setting up linux services
                and whatever little automation I built, it was done via bash scripts. I got on with the times, but I'm still playing
                with bash and configs on my own every now and again 🤓

                I'm working on a <a href="https://github.com/mayk93/MongoRouter" >mongo routing library</a>.
                Initially built on top of <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/motor">Motor</a>, I later refactored it on
                top of the more robust <a href="https://api.mongodb.com/python/current/">pymongo</a>.
                The purpose of the library is to abstract database interactions from database settings.
                You can find it on <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/MongoRouter/0.0.2">pip</a>.

                I got into programming in high school. Besides what I did in school,
                I also started doing tutorials from YouTube. I remember
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IYQiAreBUM&list=PLAD1BC7A38419037D&index=1">
                    my first Unity 3D tutorial
                </a>,
                from a German vlogger. I didn't really understand what he was saying but I typed what he was typing and
                somehow, a little racing game was made.
                The thrill of making something so awesome never left me and keeps me passionate to this day.
                I’m also an avid gamer, a huge fan of grand strategies, city builders and management games.
