                    Applied Blockchain is a blockchain applications development company,

            <ul>
                <li>
                    I worked on a blockchain powered <b>distributed exchange</b>. As part of this project, I used
                    <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>, <a href="https://redux.js.org/">Redux</a> and other
                    libraries in the React ecosystem such as

                    trading. Besides UI work, the project also required producing the
                    <a href="https://www.docker.com/">docker</a> container used in deploying the app and collaborating
                    closely with the api and smart contracts teams.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Lead frontend development for a <b>blockchain based registration system</b> for drones. I used

                </li>
                <li>
                    Built using <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/">React Native</a> a
                     <b>crypto currency</b> application. In this project interfaced with the blockchain for the first
                     time. This was done through a in house library built on top of

                </li>
                <li>
                    I built and delivered several proof of concept applications developed with React and

                <li>
                    I designed and implemented a deep learning, <b>convolutional neural network</b>, using the
                    <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">Tensorflow</a> framework together with
                    <a href="http://www.numpy.org/">numpy</a>, in python 3. This was based on Yann LeCun's
                    <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/lenet/">LeNet-5</a> network, adapted for text data as opposed to
                    image inputs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Developed and maintained the client application, wrote in <b>React</b>. This application allows
                    users to view and respond to events generated by the platform.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Additionally, I architected and deployed a client application capable of reaching both
                    regular sites and <b>hidden services</b> using
                    <a href="https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp">aiohttp</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I wrote an <b>orchestration system</b> for deploying and monitoring tor nodes. I used the python
                    <a href="https://github.com/boto/boto3">boto3</a> library to automatically provide and clean up
                    resources used by tor nodes, based on data obtained from status providers, both internal and
                    external such as <a href="https://torstatus.blutmagie.de/">blutmagie</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Set up a <b>private tor network</b> using
                    <a href="https://github.com/torproject/chutney">chutney</a> ( also available
                    <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/chutney.git">here</a> ) and deployed
                    several patched Tor nodes, in order to assess different data collection strategies.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Used the python <a href="https://stem.torproject.org/">stem</a> library to build a client capable of
                    quickly assessing the status of hidden services on the tor network. This was done as part of an
                    effort to better understand and map the <b>hidden service lifecycle</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I improved the matching engine by moving from a regex search approach, done with the re2 library to
                    a search based on the
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aho%E2%80%93Corasick_algorithm">Aho–Corasick algorithm</a>.
                    This was done using <a href="https://github.com/mayk93/pyahocorasick">pyahocorasick</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Worked on developing a user facing, <b>mobile first</b> application,
                    built with <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a> and its material design implementation,
                    <a href="https://vuetifyjs.com/en/">Vuetify</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Used <a href="https://docs.seleniumhq.org/">Selenium</a> both for end to end testing and for content
                    collection. I build using Selenium a web crawler that rendered a Firefox browser in a
                    <a href="https://www.x.org/wiki/">x server</a> and used the browser to access otherwise unavailable
                    content, such as those hidden behind a captcha.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I wrote a client that used

                    to visit and archive websites. The generated content was stored on

                <li>
                    Dramatically improved the <b>performance</b> of the document matching engine by switching from

                    Developed several <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>

                I am interested in <a href="https://www.docker.com/"></a> docker for container deployment. I learned
                to do dev-ops the hard way. SSH-ing into machines, doing manual configuration, setting up linux services
                and whatever little automation I built, I was done via bash scripts. This is not sustainable in today's
                environment for a production quality app so I am turning to docker.

            <li>
                I Started working on a <a href="https://github.com/mayk93/MongoRouter" >mongo routing library</a>.
                Initially built on top of <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/motor">Motor</a>, I later refactored it on
                top of the more robust <a href="https://api.mongodb.com/python/current/">pymongo</a>.
                The purpose of the library is to abstract database interactions from database settings.
                You can find it on <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/MongoRouter/0.0.2">pip</a>.

                For my <a href="https://github.com/mayk93/Licenta">Computer Science Bachelor project</a>,
                I developed a neural network for image classification using
                <a href="http://www.deeplearning.net/software/theano/">Theano</a>.
                The project consists of a web app, with a <b>React</b> frontend, <b>Django</b> backend and a

                I try to hone my skills in other areas as well, mostly by doing some game development either

                I got into programming in high school. Besides what I did in school,
                I also started doing tutorials from YouTube. I remember
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IYQiAreBUM&list=PLAD1BC7A38419037D&index=1">
                    my first Unity 3D tutorial
                </a>,
                from a German vlogger. I didn't really understand what he was saying but I typed what he was typing and
                somehow, a little racing game was made.
                The thrill of making something so awesome never left me and keeps me passionate to this day.
                I’m also an avid gamer, a huge fan of grand strategies, city builders and management games.
                I also like walking. A lot. And as fun as plain old walking is,
                I do sometimes sit down and read, usually articles on slashdot, hacker news or reddit.
