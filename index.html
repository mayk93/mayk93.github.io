                I Started working on a <a href="https://github.com/mayk93/MongoRouter" >mongo library</a> built on top of
                <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/motor">Motor</a>.
                The purpose of the library is to abstract database interactions from database settings.
                You can find it on <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/MongoRouter/0.0.2">pip</a>.

                For my <a href="https://github.com/mayk93/Licenta">Computer Science Bachelor project</a>,
                I developed a neural network for image classification using
                <a href="http://www.deeplearning.net/software/theano/">Theano</a>.
                The project consists of a web app, with a <b>React</b> frontend, <b>Django</b> backend and a
                classifier capable of recognising digits from the

                I spend a lot of my free time going over machine learning tutorials.
                I learn by following courses and tinkering with the projects myself.
                Currently I am looking into

                I try to hone my skills in other areas as well, mostly <b>React</b> and to a lesser extent
                <b>Riot</b> for frontend, <b>Django</b> for backend and occasionally doing some game development either
                with pygame or Unity 3D.
                I also use <b>Go</b> on occasion and played with <b>Rust</b> a few times.

            <p>
                I got into programming in high school. Besides what I did in school,
                I also started doing tutorials from YouTube. I remember
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IYQiAreBUM&list=PLAD1BC7A38419037D&index=1">
                    my first Unity 3D tutorial
                </a>,
                from a German vlogger. I didn't really understand what he was saying but I typed what he was typing and
                somehow, a little racing game was made.
                The thrill of making something so awesome never left me and keeps me passionate to this day.
                I’m also an avid gamer, a huge fan of grand strategies, city builders and management games.
                I also like walking. A lot. And as fun as plain old walking is,
                I do sometimes sit down and read, usually articles on slashdot, hacker news or reddit.
