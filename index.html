            🌍 I’m a <b>remote first engineer</b>, specialising in <b>web development</b>
            <br />
            🚀 I’m passionate about <b>performance</b> and <b>usability</b>

            My choice of vcs is no doubt <a href="https://git-scm.com/"><b>Git</b></a> and my infrastructure usually sits on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/"><b>AWS</b></a> ☁️ More likely than not I set it up with <a href="https://www.terraform.io/"><b>Terraform</b></a>.
            <br />
            Usually I prototype my <a href="https://reactjs.org/"><b>React</b></a> ⚛️ components with <a href="https://storybook.js.org/"><b>Storybook</b></a> and <a href="https://www.chromatic.com/"><b>Chromatic</b></a>. To manage my state, my first choice is <b>context</b> but if I can't have that, it's <b><a href="https://redux.js.org/">Redux</a></b> all the way. I bundle with <a href="https://webpack.js.org/"><b>Webpack</b></a> 📦 most of the time, but I'm happy to roll otherwise, such as up 😉
            <br />
            The backend, it's either <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/"><b>Node</b></a> or <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/"><b>Django</b></a>, usually talking to a <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/"><b>Mongo</b></a> cluster, ideally in <a href="https://graphql.org/"><b>GraphQL</b></a>. I'm big on <b>testing</b> so <a href="https://jestjs.io/"><b>Jest</b></a> and <a href="https://www.cypress.io/"><b>Cypress</b></a> comes in really handy! For Cypress at least, testing is a boring use case. <b>Ask me more!</b> 😁
            <br />
            Sadly, I have experience with <b>Wordpress</b> 🙁
            <br />
            At the end, when all is done, I keep an eye on stuff in <a href="https://newrelic.com/"><b>Newrelic</b></a> while enjoying some coffee ☕️

                    News UK is a British newspaper publisher and one of the largest players in the industry.
                    In this role, my work was for <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/"><b>The Sun</b></a>, one of the largest
                    publications in the UK.
                    <br/> I was part of <b>The Sun title team</b>, the group responsible for the development
                    and maintenance of a website with over <b>five million daily users</b> 💪
                </div>
                <br />
                <div>Here's some things I did over there:</div>
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I improved The Sun performance across several <a href="https://web.dev/vitals/"><b>web vitals</b></a>, both core and non-core. I reduced both <a href="https://web.dev/fcp/"><b>First Contentful Paint</b></a> and <a href="https://web.dev/tti/"><b>Time to Interactive</b></a> by a few seconds, as well as improving the <a href="https://web.dev/cls/"><b>Cumulative Layout Shift</b></a> 📈
                </li>
                <li>
                    Overhauled the <b>CSS architecture</b> resulting in a two-thirds decrease of the payload 💨
                </li>
                <li>I leveraged <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/s3-optimizing-performance-best-practices/using-caching-for-frequently-accessed-content.html"><b>caching</b></a> to reduce AWS resource use, thus saving the company over £2000 per month 💷 </li>
                <li>
                    Migrated the consent manager from <a href="https://www.onetrust.com/"><b>Onetrust</b></a> to <a href="https://www.sourcepoint.com/"><b>Sourcepoint</b></a> across all Sun websites, thus reminding myself how complicated GDPR 🇪🇺 and CCPA ☀️🏄🌴 are!
                </li>
                <li>
                    Helped perform a major infrastructure change, moving The Sun from <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/"><b>AWS EB</b></a> to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/eks/"><b>EKS</b></a>. We did this in stages and employed a <b>blue/green</b> strategy for traffic routing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Collaborated closely with the <b>analytics</b> team on several occasions, for tasks ranging from <a href="https://tealium.com/"><b>Tealium</b></a> integration to setting up an entire <b>recommendation system</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Conducted several <b>A/B</b> and <a href="https://www.optimizely.com/optimization-glossary/multivariate-testing/#:~:text=Multivariate%20testing%20is%20a%20technique,of%20combinations%20of%20changeable%20elements."><b>multivariate tests</b></a> using <a href="https://www.optimizely.com/"><b>Optimizely</b></a> 👨‍🔬 resulting in improvements to metrics such as <b>recirculation</b>, <b>conversion</b> and <b>time on site</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In general, developed, maintained and refactored The Sun website, touching everything from infrastructure, Wordpress integration, SSR, client side React, performance improvements, third party integration and more 🤩
                </li>

            <p>
                I got into programming in high school. Besides what I did in school,
                I also started doing tutorials from YouTube. I remember
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IYQiAreBUM&list=PLAD1BC7A38419037D&index=1">
                    my first Unity 3D tutorial
                </a>,
                from a German vlogger. I didn't really understand what he was saying but I typed what he was typing and
                somehow, a little racing game was made 🏎️
                The thrill of making something so awesome never left me and keeps me passionate to this day.
                I’m also an avid gamer, a huge fan of grand strategies, city builders and management games.
